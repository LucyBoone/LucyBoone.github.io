  <h1>What's Up With #Map?</h1>
  <h4>8/23/15</h4>

    <p>
      #Map, & #collect! They  do... well, exactly the same thing. They map through an array, performing a function of your choice on every element, and then returning a block filled with all the new results. Map is more conventional than collect, so that's what we're going to talk about.
    </p>
    <p> #Map is good for altering data by expanding on it: ie, doing math. If we need to add to, subtract from, multiply, or divide numbers in an array and we know we want to do it across the board, #map allows us to do this all at once:
    <pre><code>
      test_array = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
      test_array.map{|value| value*2 }
      => [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]
     </code></pre>
     It looks a little bit like the .each / do command that we can call on a method, but used in the context of arrays (and also hashes!) Since we'll often need to modify data sets all at once, it's a useful, powerful tool.

    <p> And that's all she wrote today! I hope that was helpful!
