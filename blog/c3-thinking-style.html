    <p> Let's talk about my brain! ... Well, that's not a weird way to get things started at all... <br>
    In all seriousness... I'm an Abstract Random thinker, and I connected with this the minute I read the breakdown. (Sidebar: if I get nothing else out of my DBC experience, I'll depart with the knowledge that I'm a kinetic learner & an abstract random thinker, which have been huge takeaways for me thus far.) I think the biggest benefit to my thinking style where DBC is concerned is comfort working in teams, and developing relationships. I'm not afraid to dive into pairing or to take the wheel, and I think that will serve me well throughout.
    </p>
    <p> On the other hand... that's probably also one of my biggest struggles in Phase 0. I feel very alone & without a team right now, and that's rough. I need to take better advantage of the people who are already geographically close, and maybe shoot for some face-to-face pairings as things get more intense.
    </p>
    <p> I'd say second biggest has been concentrating on one thing at a time, and making sure I am completely done with a challenge before moving on. My plan moving forward to deal with this is to enter work into the weekly feedback report as I complete it, so that I have a running log of what I have and haven't done, and there's no guessing. I know I'm inclined to get distracted and move on, (I do it at home, at work, in the middle of conversations...) so I need to make changing that habit a real priority over the next few weeks.
