      I'm supposed to reflect on whether or not the Chefs-in-the-kitchen perspective alters my perception of DBC, and how I feel about that mindset... but honestly, that mindset is why I'm here. That's what I want, yo! I can't sit and be lectured at. I can't do dry and boring and this is how we code and there's one way to code and now go make shitty apps and don't think another thought again about what it is you're doing in your working life. I want to get my hands dirty, and I want to talk and interact. I need the structure and the community. Part of why I'm so pumped that someone in my accountability group through out early that we should all hang out is that Phase O feels like it's going to be the roughest part for me. I know the material will be more difficult later, sure. But there will be people and instructors and a community, and that will help a ton. I might be getting off topic... Anyway, I want to get involved, I have thoughts and ideas and things. It'll be easier, I think, as it goes and my comfort with people and ideas grows. Really and truly, I just can't wait for September!
