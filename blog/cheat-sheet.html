        <h2>Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods</h2>
        <p>In real life, a car is an object. A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop. All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times. Objects are variables that contain many values:
        <pre><code>
        var car = {type:"Fiat", model:500, color:"white"};
       </pre></code>
       The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon). The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.
       <pre><code>
        var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
       </pre></code>
      </p>
