  <h1>Ruby on Rails: A Quick & Dirty Primer</h1>

  <p>Parsing the language of software development can be complicated for a beginner. For example, you might here about Ruby and you might then hear about Ruby on Rails, and assume that they are interchangable, and that when someone refers to "Ruby," this is just an abreviation for "Ruby on Rails." That certainly feels like a safe assumption... But wait, what does it mean when we just refer to "Rails"? What is Ruby on Rails (aside from maybe the world's worst roller coaster) and how does it differ from Ruby?</p>
  <p> Ruby, as we should well know by now, is an object-oriented programming language that was developed in the 1990s. Ruby on Rails, or simply "Rails" is its much newer companion.
  </p>
  <p> At a very basic level, Rails is just another Ruby Gem, which extends and enhances the Ruby language. That drastically undersells just what Rails is capable of, though. Rails is really an open-source web framework, which combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a Ruby foundation to allow the creation of complex websites and web applications. Rails was designed for simplicity; it is built off of Ruby because the language is so noteably clean and easy to follow. Rails is considered an "opinionated software," meaning there are specific ways to solve development problems; follow the Rails protocol and you'll have fewer decisions to make, and be able to take advantage of built in solutions.
  </p> And here comes the rub of Rails: giving up your autonomy as a developer. Rails is designed for convention over configuration, and there are myriad benefits to unity of code and always being able to understand why and how something was done. Rails does allow for some substitution, but asks its users to trust that the conventions its laid out and the decisions made are carefully studied, and that trust should be put in them - to borrow from the creator Rails, David Heinemeier Hansson's own metaphor, it's a bit like a restaurant patron trusting in the chef to create the best meal possible. Maybe it wouldn't be what you wouldn't have chosen, but you're trusting in this person's knowledge and expertise for a good outcome.

    <p> And that's all she wrote today! I hope that was helpful!
